# Random-password-Generator
Having a weak password is not good for a system that demands high confidentiality and security of user credentials.
It turns out that people find it difficult to make up a strong password that is strong enough to prevent unauthorized users from memorizing it. 
This project uses a mixture of numbers, alphabets, and other symbols found on the computer keyboard to form  password which is unpredictable 
and cannot easily be memorized.
